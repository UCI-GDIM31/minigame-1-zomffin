## Devlog
If I were to explain to another student how Components, GameObjects, and Scenes, I would describe it like how a physical game board works.
GameObjects are like pieces on the board- ex. like a player's player piece in Monopoly, or the cards, and buildings. 
The components are the game rules that the pieces obey. The rules of how they can move and interact with other objects are controlled by the Components-
or the game rules.
The Scene is the entire game board- encompassing all the pieces (GameObjects), and the rules (components). 
A different scene can be a different gameboard, or just the gameboard with a new theme and setup but the same rules.
Like to come back to the Monopoly example: There are many different versions of Monopoly that obey the classic rules of Monopoly but may have
different themes, and slightly different rules (how the cards are written and played), these can be different Scenes.
